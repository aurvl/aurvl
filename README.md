## **Hi, I’m Aurel !**👋

As a second-year Master’s student in Economics, specializing in Economic Data Expertise and Analysis at Université Côte d'Azur, I’m passionate about solving economic and social challenges through data. 📊📈 Throughout my studies, I’ve developed strong analytical skills and a deep interest in real-world applications of economic theory. 🌍

I’m currently focusing on expanding my expertise in machine learning, data analysis, and programming. 💻 On my GitHub profile, I showcase various projects that reflect my growing skillset in these areas, including Python scripts, data analysis workflows, and financial models. 🛠️ These projects highlight my ability to approach complex problems with a data-driven mindset. 🚀

I’m always eager to collaborate on innovative projects and grow my network, while learning from others in the field. 🤝 Driven by my ambition and love for economic and social sciences, I aim to contribute to data-driven solutions that can create a positive impact. 🌟
