**Hi, I’m Aurel VEHI !**

As a second-year Master’s student in Economics, specializing in Economic Data Expertise and Analysis at Université Côte d'Azur, I’m passionate about leveraging data to solve complex economic and social challenges. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve honed my analytical skills, developed creative problem-solving approaches, and nurtured a deep interest in both economic theory and its real-world applications. 

Driven by ambition and a love for economic and social sciences, I aim to contribute to impactful research and data-driven solutions. I’m always eager to collaborate, learn, and bring innovative insights to the table.
