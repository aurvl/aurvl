## **Hi, I’m Aurel !**

As a second-year Master’s student in Economics, specializing in Economic Data Expertise and Analysis at Université Côte d'Azur, I’m passionate about solving economic and social challenges through data. Throughout my studies, I’ve developed strong analytical skills and a deep interest in real-world applications of economic theory.

I’m currently focusing on expanding my expertise in machine learning, data analysis, and programming. On my GitHub profile, I showcase various projects that reflect my growing skillset in these areas, including Python scripts, data analysis workflows, and financial models. These projects highlight my ability to approach complex problems with a data-driven mindset.

I’m always eager to collaborate on innovative projects and grow my network, while learning from others in the field. Driven by my ambition and love for economic and social sciences, I aim to contribute to data-driven solutions that can create a positive impact.
